The Adapted Vulkan Toturial shows how to draw an object using the Vulkan API. It is based on the origin Vulkan Tutorial, but has been adapted to include the following features:

* SDL2 instead of GLFW
* Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA)
* Volk function loader
* Imgui
* Slang instead of GLSL

All features accept Imgui are already part of the Vulkan SDK, and thus make sense to be used.
